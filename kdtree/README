This distribution contains the KDTREE, KDTREEIDX and KDRANGEQUERY functions.

**** IMPORTANT ***
You will need to compile the code in the kdtree/src library using your
MATLAB's mex compiler.

You can simply try to use the following commands or 
type "help mex" to learn more about compiling mex-functions.

>> cd kdtree/lib
>> edit ../src/kdtree_common.h   % Edit this file to set your system headers.
>> mex ../src/kdtree.cc
>> mex ../src/kdtreeidx.cc
>> mex ../src/kdrangequery.cc

Finally, be sure to add the kdtree/lib directory to your MATLAB PATH.

**** IMPORTANT ***

Two demo scripts are provided (kdtree_demo.m & kdrange_demo.m).

Features added June 2004:
	+  You can now use N dimensional data points, where N>3.
	+  Use KDTREEIND to return the index value to the closest point, 
	   instead of the closest point values.
	+  KDRANGEQUERY can now return these index values as well.
